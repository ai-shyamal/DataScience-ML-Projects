# ðŸ§  Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository showcases my Data Science and Machine Learning projects built using Python, covering areas such as predictive modeling, classification, regression, deep learning, and recommender systems.

## ðŸ§© Projects

### 1. [Customer Lifetime Value Forecasting And Segmentation](1-clv-forecasting-segmentation.ipynb/)
Predicting future spending and segmenting customers using Neural Networks and Regression models to identify high-value customers for targeted marketing strategies.

### 2. [Transact Guard : Fraud Risk Modeling using ML](2.%20transact-guard-fraud-risk-modeling%20using%20ml.ipynb/)
Detecting fraudulent transactions on a highly imbalanced dataset using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks with SMOTE and class-weight balancing.

### 3. [Movie Recommendation System (Collaborative Filtering)](3.%20movie-recommendation-system-collaborative-filtering.ipynb/)
Building a collaborative filteringâ€“based recommender system to predict movie ratings and provide personalized recommendations using userâ€“item interaction data.
